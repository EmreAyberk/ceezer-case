## Ceezer Portfolio Case

This NestJS project is designed to implement a specific use-case scenario through its controllers, services, and modules. The core functionality revolves around handling requests through a dedicated controller and processing logic within corresponding service layers.

### Features

- Modular Structure: Organized into modules to keep features and functionalities well-structured and maintainable.
- Built-in Validation & Error Handling: Utilizes NestJS decorators and exception filters to ensure input data integrity and provide meaningful error responses.
- Scalable & Testable: The project structure, along with NestJS’s core principles, ensures easy scalability and straightforward testing.

### Requirements

- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Node.js: v14 or higher
- npm: v6 or higher (or yarn equivalent)

Ensure you have the required dependencies and tools installed before proceeding.

### Swagger

Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI at:

URL: http://localhost:8080/swagger

### Working with Local

```bash
$ cd backend
$ npm install
```

before you run the project you need to set env

```bash
nano .env
```

and then copy this fields

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=portfolio
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASSWORD=root
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=8080
```

now you can easily start your application

```bash
$ npm run start
```

#### Run tests

```bash
$ npm run test
```

### Project Structure

WA typical NestJS project structure is followed, with the main components including:
• src Folder: Contains all source code (controllers, services, modules, etc.).
• main.ts: The entry point of the application.
• app.module.ts: The root module importing and configuring other modules.
• app.controller.ts & app.service.ts: Example controller and service to handle incoming requests and business logic.

A sample structure:

### A typical top-level directory layout

    src
    ├─ config
    ├─ portfolio
    │  ├─ controller
    │  ├─ dto
    │  ├─ entity
    │  ├─ interface
    │  ├─ repository
    │  ├─ service
    │  └─ portfolio.module.ts
    ├─ seed
    ├─ shared
    │  ├─ filters
    │  └─ services
    ├─ types
    │  ├─ http
    ...

### Example Endpoint

You can interact with the API using the following example endpoint:

- POST http://localhost:8080/portfolio/generate: Generate a portfolio based on the provided input parameters.

```
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/portfolio/generate' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "desiredVolumeInTons": 79
}'
```
